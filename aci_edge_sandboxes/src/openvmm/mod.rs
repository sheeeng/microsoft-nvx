//! Default backend: drives the `openvmm` binary directly.
//!
//! Each sandbox is a microVM that runs the NVX guest's Alpine Linux userland directly from its
//! initramfs; there are no image layers, scratch disks, or container namespaces. Guest state lives
//! in memory and lasts until the sandbox stops.
//!
//! [`OpenVmmBackend`] keeps each sandbox in a state directory under
//! [`OpenVmmConfig::state_root`], so every operation can run in a different process:
//!
//! - **provision** validates the request and records the configuration. No VM runs yet.
//! - **start** launches a detached OpenVMM process with the managed lifecycle, passes it a fresh
//!   32-byte capability through standard input, and waits until the guest agent answers on the
//!   authenticated control console. The agent must also advertise the control features this
//!   backend depends on (cancellation, host path mappings, workload accounts, workload
//!   containment, per-execution environments, and working directories). A guest image that lacks
//!   one is terminated and start fails with
//!   [`ErrorCode::BackendUnavailable`](crate::ErrorCode::BackendUnavailable), because such an
//!   image would silently ignore the policy or request that needs the feature.
//! - **exec** runs the workload through the control console and streams its output live.
//! - **stop** asks the guest to shut down and falls back to terminating OpenVMM after
//!   [`OpenVmmConfig::stop_timeout`].
//! - **deprovision** deletes the state directory.
//!
//! Every operation first reconciles the recorded OpenVMM process with the host: a sandbox whose
//! VM died is treated as provisioned again.
//!
//! # Policy honor matrix
//!
//! | Field | provision | exec |
//! | --- | --- | --- |
//! | `filesystem.readonlyPaths`, `readwritePaths` | mapped at their [`guest_path`] | n/a |
//! | `filesystem.deniedPaths` | hidden inside mapped paths | n/a |
//! | `network.egress` | default and IPv4 rules applied | n/a |
//! | `network.ingress`, `hostLoopback` | `deny` only | n/a |
//! | `microvm.provision.memoryMib` | applied | n/a |
//! | `process.commandLine` | n/a | run as `/bin/sh -c <commandLine>`, at most 4096 bytes |
//! | `process.cwd` | n/a | an absolute guest path of at most 4095 bytes; `/` when omitted |
//! | `process.timeout` | n/a | up to one hour |
//! | `process.env`, `inheritDefaultEnv` | n/a | applied per execution; see [Environment](#environment) |
//! | piped stdin | n/a | rejected |
//!
//! The guest agent enters the working directory with the workload's identity before it starts
//! the workload. A directory that does not exist, is not a directory, or that the workload cannot
//! search fails the launch instead: the execution ends with [`ExecFailure::WorkingDirectory`]
//! after a diagnostic on standard error, and nothing runs. Relative paths are rejected with
//! [`ErrorCode::PolicyValidation`](crate::ErrorCode::PolicyValidation); [`guest_path`]
//! translates host paths.
//!
//! Host paths share OpenVMM's single virtio-fs export: the backend exports the deepest directory
//! that contains every mapped path to a guest directory that only the guest's root can enter, and
//! the guest agent bind-mounts each mapped path, read-only or read-write. Egress rules are expanded
//! into OpenVMM's IPv4 rules exactly; IPv6, ICMP-only rules, and rules that would need more than
//! 256 OpenVMM rules are rejected. Egress denied without allow rules, with ingress denied,
//! attaches no network device. Workloads run as the fixed non-root identity of
//! [`OpenVmmConfig::workload_uid`] and [`OpenVmmConfig::workload_gid`] (see
//! [`OpenVmmConfig::map_host_identity`] for Linux hosts) with no capabilities, read end-of-file on
//! standard input, and may produce at most 1 MiB of combined output.
//!
//! # Environment
//!
//! Each execution starts from its own environment, so nothing carries over from an earlier one.
//! Without `process.env`, the workload gets the guest's default environment: `PATH`, `TERM`, the
//! `HOME`, `USER`, and `LOGNAME` of the workload identity, and `PWD`, which names the working
//! directory, plus a few variables that the guest's boot leaves behind. It never holds the host's
//! variables. Supplied entries, even an empty list, are the complete environment, unless
//! `inheritDefaultEnv` is true, which layers them over the default one, each entry replacing the
//! default variable of the same name. Without `process.env`, `inheritDefaultEnv` has no effect.
//!
//! The exec request carries the entries, at most 256 with unique names, in a field of their own,
//! next to the working directory and the arguments. The guest agent enters the working directory
//! with the workload's identity, and applies the entries after it has dropped the workload's
//! privileges, just before it starts the program, so a `process.argv` program receives exactly
//! the requested environment. A `process.commandLine` runs in `/bin/sh`, and that shell is the
//! workload, so it exports variables of its own: BusyBox's `sh` sets `SHLVL` and `PWD`, also
//! when an entry has one of those names.
//!
//! # Concurrency and cancellation
//!
//! Lifecycle transitions of one sandbox are serialized by a lock file. Executions are serialized
//! by the guest: a second exec waits up to [`OpenVmmConfig::control_timeout`] for the first to
//! finish. A stop that cannot reach the guest within its timeout terminates the VM, and any
//! running exec then fails.
//!
//! The guest agent contains each workload in a cgroup and kills whatever the workload leaves
//! behind when its first process exits, so no workload process outlives its exec.
//! [`Canceller::cancel`](crate::Canceller::cancel) asks the guest to kill the workload; the
//! execution then ends with [`ExecOutcome::Cancelled`]. If the process that runs an execution
//! dies, the guest kills the workload as soon as it notices that the control session is gone.
