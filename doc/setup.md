# Setup

## Initialize

Clone with submodules, or initialize after cloning:

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules <umbrella-repository-url> nvx
cd nvx
python3 scripts/nvx.py verify
```

On Windows PowerShell, use `python` in place of `python3` if that is the
installed launcher:

```powershell
git clone --recurse-submodules <umbrella-repository-url> nvx
Set-Location nvx
python scripts\nvx.py verify
```

If the checkout already exists:

```bash
python3 scripts/nvx.py init
```

## Prerequisites

Python 3.10 or newer and Git are required on every platform.

By default, a microVM boots on the built-in
[CPU profile](usage.md#cpu-profiles) of its host's CPU, so the host needs a CPU
that one of OpenVMM's built-in profiles serves, four Intel generations and
AMD's EPYC Milan, on a hypervisor that supports that profile. On another
Intel or AMD CPU, or where the hypervisor does not support the built-in
profile (`E_PROFILE_UNSUPPORTED`, whose message names this option),
`nvx.py run --cpu-profile host` opts in to a development profile derived from
the host, which OpenVMM verifies as it verifies a built-in profile: the cold
boot still fails with `E_PROFILE_UNSUPPORTED` if the hypervisor lacks a CPU
feature that the time ABI requires. CPUs of other vendors have no CPU
profiles.

For Debian/Ubuntu hosts:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y \
  bc binutils bison build-essential ca-certificates cpio curl erofs-utils flex \
  gzip libelf-dev libssl-dev musl-tools python3 rsync tar xz-utils zstd
```

`musl-tools` provides `musl-gcc`, which native initramfs builds use for the
guest time tools; Docker builds install it in the build image.

### Linux / KVM

Enable Intel VT-x or AMD-V in the host firmware. Linux normally loads the matching KVM kernel
module automatically; `/dev/kvm` should exist after boot. Add the current user to the `kvm` group:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG kvm "$USER"
```

Log out and back in after changing groups, then check access with
`test -r /dev/kvm && test -w /dev/kvm`.

### Linux / MSHV

MSHV requires Linux running as a Microsoft Hypervisor root partition with an MSHV-enabled kernel.
The kernel must expose `/dev/mshv`; if its MSHV root driver is a module, load it with:

```bash
sudo modprobe mshv_root
```

Grant the current session read/write access and verify the device:

```bash
sudo chmod a+rw /dev/mshv
test -r /dev/mshv && test -w /dev/mshv
```

RPM-based MSHV hosts also need the native toolchain used to build the pinned
cargo-nextest release:

```bash
sudo tdnf install -y \
  gcc glibc-devel kernel-headers binutils make \
  pkgconf pkgconf-pkg-config openssl-devel libarchive
cargo install --locked cargo-nextest --version 0.9.133
```

### Windows / WHP

Enable hardware virtualization in the host firmware. Then enable **Windows Hypervisor Platform**
from an elevated PowerShell session and reboot:

```powershell
Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName HypervisorPlatform -All
```

Building NVX locally also requires Rust stable, Visual Studio 2022 C++ build tools, the Windows
SDK, and Docker Desktop using Linux containers.

## Automated environment bootstrap

The scripts in [`scripts/setup`](../scripts/setup/README.md) prepare Linux/KVM, Linux/MSHV, and
Windows/WHP development or GitHub Actions hosts. They install the platform build prerequisites,
configure hypervisor access, and provide non-mutating validation modes. Runner registration
tokens are read from standard input so they do not appear in command history.

Linux can also emit a revision-bound, checksummed guest artifact bundle for Windows. The Windows
script verifies that bundle before copying it into the checkout and building OpenVMM natively.

## Remote agent hosts

The NVX agent skills can run and diagnose NVX on preconfigured SSH hosts. Remote development is
opt-in: copy the tracked host inventory template to the ignored `.nvx-hosts.json` file at the
repository root.

On Linux:

```bash
cp scripts/nvx-hosts.example.json .nvx-hosts.json
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
Copy-Item scripts\nvx-hosts.example.json .nvx-hosts.json
```

The inventory schema is intentionally unversioned. Its top-level object contains
only `hosts`; do not add a `version` field.

Edit each profile in `.nvx-hosts.json`:

- The profile name is the name supplied to the `nvx-host-connect` skill.
- `ssh_target` is one destination or alias configured in the developer's SSH configuration.
- `backend` is exactly one of `kvm`, `mshv`, or `whp`.
- `host_type` is required, identifies the server itself, and is exactly one of
  `baremetal` or `virtual-machine`.
- `remote_repo` is the absolute path to the NVX checkout on that host. It may be omitted so the
  agent asks for it when connecting.
- `notes` is optional developer-local context.

Keep authentication in the SSH agent and SSH configuration. Do not put passwords, tokens,
private keys, passphrases, or SSH options in `.nvx-hosts.json`. The file is ignored by Git.

List and validate the configured profiles on Linux with:

```bash
python3 .github/skills/nvx-host-connect/scripts/hosts.py
```

On Windows PowerShell, use:

```powershell
python .github\skills\nvx-host-connect\scripts\hosts.py
```

If the inventory is absent or contains no hosts, the resolver disables remote access and reports
that only local NVX development is enabled.

## Development

Install the pinned Python development tools:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --requirement requirements-dev.txt
```

Install ShellCheck 0.11.0 and shfmt 3.12.0 using the platform package manager
to match the versions enforced in CI.

Run all lint and formatting checks before submitting a change:

```bash
python3 -m ruff check scripts .github/specula
shellcheck --shell=sh \
  guest/common/init guest/alpine/nvx-container-enter \
  guest/alpine/nvx-container-launch \
  guest/common/nvx-hostmount guest/common/nvx-identity-probe \
  guest/common/nvx-init-agent \
  guest/common/nvx-container-enter-azurelinux \
  guest/common/nvx-container-launch-azurelinux \
  guest/common/nvx-sandbox-smoke \
  guest/common/nvx-snapshot guest/common/nvx-virtio-restore-probe \
  scripts/setup/setup-linux-mshv.sh scripts/setup/setup-linux-runner.sh
shellcheck --shell=bash \
  .github/specula/setup-runner.sh guest/ubuntu/nvx-bashrc
python3 -m pyright --pythonplatform Linux
python3 -m pyright --pythonplatform Windows
python3 -m ruff format --check scripts .github/specula
shfmt -d -ln posix -i 4 -ci \
  guest/common/init guest/alpine/nvx-container-enter \
  guest/alpine/nvx-container-launch \
  guest/common/nvx-hostmount guest/common/nvx-identity-probe \
  guest/common/nvx-init-agent \
  guest/common/nvx-container-enter-azurelinux \
  guest/common/nvx-container-launch-azurelinux \
  guest/common/nvx-sandbox-smoke \
  guest/common/nvx-snapshot guest/common/nvx-virtio-restore-probe \
  scripts/setup/setup-linux-mshv.sh scripts/setup/setup-linux-runner.sh
shfmt -d -ln bash -i 4 -ci \
  .github/specula/setup-runner.sh guest/ubuntu/nvx-bashrc
```

Pyright runs in strict mode for both Linux and Windows platform APIs.

### Adversarial campaign controller

The optional `test-adversarial` command additionally requires GitHub Copilot
CLI to be installed and authenticated before the run. Validate the controller
without changing authentication:

```bash
copilot --version
```

The harness performs its own non-interactive authenticated smoke prompt and
fails preflight if it cannot complete. It deliberately does not install
Copilot CLI or run `copilot login`. The repository's
`.github/workflows/copilot-setup-steps.yml` prepares Copilot cloud agent
sessions but does not install or authenticate Copilot CLI, so it does not
satisfy this prerequisite.

Production campaigns also require an administrator-owned, no-argument
executor wrapper that provisions a separate disposable target and forwards
the bounded executor protocol. See
[Copilot-driven adversarial testing](design/copilot-adversarial-testing.md)
for the containment and credential requirements.

Apply the configured Python and POSIX shell formatters with:

```bash
python3 -m ruff format scripts .github/specula
shfmt -w -ln posix -i 4 -ci \
  guest/common/init guest/alpine/nvx-container-enter \
  guest/alpine/nvx-container-launch \
  guest/common/nvx-hostmount guest/common/nvx-identity-probe \
  guest/common/nvx-init-agent guest/common/nvx-sandbox-smoke \
  guest/common/nvx-snapshot guest/common/nvx-virtio-restore-probe \
  scripts/setup/setup-linux-mshv.sh scripts/setup/setup-linux-runner.sh
shfmt -w -ln bash -i 4 -ci \
  .github/specula/setup-runner.sh guest/ubuntu/nvx-bashrc
```
