# Project structure

This document describes the NVX repository layout. Paths marked as generated
are build products or caches and are not part of the tracked source tree. The
`openvmm/` directory is a Git submodule maintained in a separate repository.

The ignored `.cache/` directory may also appear at the repository root. It
contains downloaded and prepared upstream source trees, including Linux.

## Source directories

### `.github/`

Repository automation and Copilot customizations live here. `workflows/ci.yml`
defines the main CI pipeline and its job-level orchestration. The `actions/`
directory contains the reusable implementations for validation, artifact
builds, benchmarks, packaging, releases, and performance history management.
The `skills/` directory defines Copilot agent skills for common development
workflows. The `specula/` directory contains the adapter, tests, and dedicated
runner setup for incremental formal verification of the pinned OpenVMM release.

### `guest/` and `ubuntu/`

`guest/common` contains scripts and static helper sources shared by the Alpine
and Ubuntu initramfs builds. `init` controls early boot, emits a stable
distribution marker, and launches either the normal guest shell or the
Alpine-only `nvx-init-agent` sandbox profile. `guest/alpine` contains the
musl-linked container-entry helpers that are not installed in the Ubuntu
initramfs. The sandbox helpers resolve fixed virtio-blk roles through
sysfs, assemble EROFS lower layers over ext4 scratch, place the workload in its
cgroup before release, construct its mount/PID/UTS namespaces, enter its
filesystem root after dropping capabilities, and retain the agent as the outer
PID 1. In a managed sandbox, the agent supervises `nvx-managed-agent` and
performs the ordered unmount teardown after a stop request. The remaining
common helpers handle shutdown, virtio-fs mounting, and
snapshot preparation. `ubuntu/packages.lock.json` pins the complete
supplemental `.deb` closure installed without maintainer-script execution.
`azurelinux/packages.lock.json` pins the SHA-256 of every RPM that the Azure
Linux initramfs adds to its digest-pinned base image; the Docker build
downloads exactly those RPMs, verifies their checksums and signatures, and
installs them without resolving packages from a repository.
Update it whenever the base image pin or the added packages change.

### `data/`

Benchmark data owned by local runs and CI. The platform CSVs at its root are
rolling performance-gate histories maintained by CI. Ignored subdirectories
hold run logs, downloaded artifacts, collected results, and gate inputs.

### `docker/`

The container definition used to build the Linux kernel, the Alpine, Ubuntu,
and Azure Linux initramfs images, and the Ubuntu EROFS distro layer in a
reproducible Linux environment.

### `kernel/`

Inputs owned by NVX for producing the guest kernel. `config-microvm` defines the
kernel build. `config-microvm-debug` is a fragment applied on top of it for the
CI debug kernel. Files in `patches/` are applied in name order to the pinned Linux
source. `COPYING-LINUX` records the upstream Linux copyright and license
notice. See the [build guide](build.md#building-the-packaged-linux-source) for
kernel-specific details.

### `aci_edge_sandboxes/`

The Rust crate `aci_edge_sandboxes`, which exposes the five-phase state-aware sandbox lifecycle
(provision, start, exec, stop, and deprovision) to consumers such as MXC. It
defines the contract types, a pluggable backend trait, and the default backend,
which launches the `openvmm` binary and speaks the guest agent's control
protocol. The crate builds independently of the OpenVMM submodule. See its
[README](../aci_edge_sandboxes/README.md) for the API, the policy honor matrix, and tests.

### `openvmm/`

A private Git submodule pinned by `.gitmodules` and the parent repository's Git
tree. It contains the VMM implementation and its own source layout,
documentation, tests, and build configuration. Changes to OpenVMM should be
made in that repository and then recorded here by updating the submodule pin.

### `scripts/`

Host-side Python tooling. `nvx.py` is the public entry point; command
implementations live in `nvx_tools/`, and `nvx_tools/build_config.py` carries
the aggregate runtime configuration plus specialized Docker, initramfs,
distro-layer, kernel, and OpenVMM build configurations consumed by each
workflow. Fixed inputs and defaults live in
[`nvx_tools/build_constants.py`](../scripts/nvx_tools/build_constants.py), using
class-qualified constants such as `KernelBuildConstants.VERSION`. The constants
module has no dependencies on the workflow or configuration modules.
Standalone benchmark shell programs and parameterized guest templates
live in `nvx_tools/benchmark_scripts/`.
Source-collection scripts assemble corresponding-source archives for Linux and
Alpine, and Ubuntu. The adversarial controller, typed broker, credential-free
executor, watchdog, and tracked deterministic catalogs also live in
`nvx_tools/`; `nvx_adversarial_executor.py` is the restricted protocol entry
point used by local children and administrator-owned remote wrappers.
Performance scripts analyze benchmark outputs, with adjacent `test_*.py` files
covering those utilities.
