# Command-line usage

`scripts/nvx.py` is the supported command-line entry point for building,
running, benchmarking, and packaging NVX. Run it from the repository root with
Python 3.10 or newer:

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py COMMAND [OPTIONS]
```

The examples on this page use the POSIX spelling. On Windows, use
`python scripts\nvx.py` instead. Every command accepts `-h` or `--help`,
including nested commands:

```console
python3 scripts/nvx.py --help
python3 scripts/nvx.py run --help
python3 scripts/nvx.py performance gate --help
```

## Initialization and verification

### `init`

```console
python3 scripts/nvx.py init
```

Initializes and recursively updates the OpenVMM Git submodule.

### `verify`

```console
python3 scripts/nvx.py verify
```

Verifies the repository's pinned source inputs and submodule state.

### `setup-cross-os-cache`

```console
python3 scripts/nvx.py setup-cross-os-cache
```

Installs the GNU tar and zstd tools used by GitHub Actions cross-OS caches.

### `check-required-ci`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py check-required-ci
    --event-name {pull_request,push}
    --same-repository {false,true}
    --run-tests VALUE
    --run-workloads VALUE
```

Validates the GitHub Actions result values supplied through the
`QUALITY_RESULT`, `CHANGES_RESULT`, and job-specific `*_RESULT` environment
variables. CI supplies `true` or `false` for the two workload flags. The
command expects successful results for jobs enabled by the event, repository,
and workload flags, and `skipped` for jobs that are not enabled; mismatches
are reported as errors and cause a nonzero exit.

See [Setup](setup.md) for host prerequisites.

### `materialize-kernel-provenance-inputs`

```console
python3 scripts/nvx.py materialize-kernel-provenance-inputs
```

Recreates the tracked kernel configuration and patch files from the current
Git run head. It removes stale worktree patches that are absent from that
revision and is used before packaging kernel provenance inputs.

## Build commands

### `build-guest`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py build-guest
    [--guest {alpine,ubuntu,azurelinux,all}]
    [--native]
    [--debug-kernel]
```

By default, builds the guest kernel and initramfs with Docker. `--native`
builds the selected artifacts directly on Linux instead. Alpine is the
default. Azure Linux does not support `--native` and always builds through
Docker. `--guest all` also builds the Ubuntu EROFS distro layer.
`--debug-kernel` also builds the CI debug kernel, `build/vmlinux-debug`; see
[Build](build.md#ci-debug-kernel).

### `build-kernel`

```console
python3 scripts/nvx.py build-kernel [--debug]
```

Fetches, verifies, patches, and builds the pinned kernel directly on Linux.
`--debug` builds the CI debug variant instead of the production kernel.

### `build-initramfs`

```console
python3 scripts/nvx.py build-initramfs [--guest {alpine,ubuntu,azurelinux}]
```

Builds the selected initramfs. Alpine and Ubuntu build directly on Linux; Azure
Linux uses Docker. Alpine is the default.

### `build-distro-layer`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py build-distro-layer
    --guest ubuntu
    [--output PATH]
    [--replace]
```

Builds the immutable Ubuntu EROFS `distro` layer directly on Linux. The default
output is `build/ubuntu-distro.erofs`. Existing output or manifest files are
rejected unless `--replace` is present.

### `verify-guest-determinism`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py verify-guest-determinism
    --guest ubuntu
    [--work-dir PATH]
```

Currently supports only `--guest ubuntu`. It builds the Ubuntu initramfs and
EROFS layer twice from separate roots and compares every artifact SHA-256. A
mismatch reports the first differing normalized rootfs entry when one exists.

### `build-openvmm`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py build-openvmm [--skip-restore] [--backend {kvm,mshv,whp}]
```

Builds the `openvmm` release binary. Before building, the command runs
`cargo xflowey restore-packages`; use `--skip-restore` when those packages are
already restored. Without `--backend`, Windows builds the native MSVC target
and Linux builds the native GNU target. On Linux, `--backend kvm` selects GNU
and `--backend mshv` selects musl; Windows accepts `--backend whp`. Build-target
selection does not probe `/dev/kvm` or `/dev/mshv`, so compilation also works
on build-only hosts and hosts exposing both devices. Unsupported OS/backend
combinations are rejected.

### `record-openvmm-provenance`

```console
python3 scripts/nvx.py record-openvmm-provenance
```

Records the checked-out OpenVMM revision, clean-state flag, and executable
SHA-256 for the existing `openvmm/target/release/openvmm[.exe]` binary in
`build/openvmm.provenance.json`. The command takes no options. It requires
the OpenVMM submodule to be checked out/initialized and the release binary to
already exist at `openvmm/target/release/openvmm` on POSIX or
`openvmm/target/release/openvmm.exe` on Windows. The command fails if either
prerequisite is missing.

### `build`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py build
    [--guest {alpine,ubuntu,azurelinux,all}]
    [--native]
    [--debug-kernel]
    [--skip-restore]
    [--backend {kvm,mshv,whp}]
```

Runs `build-guest` followed by `build-openvmm`. The options have the same
meaning as on those individual commands.

See [Build](build.md) for dependencies, outputs, and native build details.

## Test commands

### `test-openvmm-unit`

```console
python3 scripts/nvx.py test-openvmm-unit
```

Runs the OpenVMM workspace's unit-test binaries with cargo-nextest's `agent`
profile and the `ci` feature. Packages that require specialized test harnesses
are excluded, along with all fuzz crates reported by OpenVMM's `xtask`.
Afterward, runs the workspace doctests with Cargo.

### `test-openvmm`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py test-openvmm --backend {kvm,mshv,whp}
```

Builds and runs OpenVMM's checkout-owned VMM tests. The Linux-direct microVM
TTRPC test boots NVX's `build/vmlinux` and `build/initramfs.cpio.gz`, so build
the guest first; the remaining test artifacts are produced by OpenVMM itself.

### `test-microvm`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py test-microvm
    --backend {kvm,mshv,whp}
    [--guest {alpine,ubuntu,azurelinux}]
    [--scenario SCENARIO]...
    [--debug-kernel]
    [--processors {1,2,4,8} ...]
    [--memory-mib MIB]
    [--timeout SECONDS]
    [--output-dir PATH]
```

Runs NVX-owned Linux, SMP, virtio, sandbox, and snapshot correctness scenarios
against the public OpenVMM CLI. Repeat `--scenario` to select a subset; without
it, every scenario supported by the selected guest runs, except `smp-lapic`,
which runs only when named: it repeats `smp` and also asserts that every CPU
uses the one-shot counting LAPIC. Alpine remains the
default. Ubuntu and Azure Linux cannot act as sandbox control, so they reject
the Alpine-control-only `sandbox-blocks` and `scratch-snapshot` scenarios and
the sandbox-control-dependent `snapshot-tiers` scenario. Ubuntu also rejects
the Alpine-prompt-specific `console-snapshot` scenario. `--debug-kernel` boots
the CI debug kernel, `build/vmlinux-debug`, whose soft-lockup and hung-task
detectors the guest's time ABI watcher reports; without `--scenario`, it runs
only the same-host restore scenarios `smp`, `smp-snapshot`,
`restore-processors`, `restore-downtime`, and `snapshot-tiers`. The command
requires `build/vmlinux` (with `--debug-kernel`, `build/vmlinux-debug` and its
`build/vmlinux-debug.config`), the selected initramfs, and
`openvmm/target/release/openvmm[.exe]`.

### `doctor`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py doctor
    --backend {kvm,mshv,whp}
    [--checks ID ...]
    [--openvmm PATH]
    [--kernel PATH]
    [--initrd PATH]
    [--cpu-fingerprint PATH | --no-openvmm]
    [--ci-schedule]
    [--probe-dir PATH]
    [--summary PATH]
    [--timeout SECONDS]
```

Qualifies this host for the [time ABI](design/time-abi.md#host-qualification).
It runs the selected checks in spec order, prints one
`NVX-DOCTOR: check=<id> status=<pass|fail> detail="..."` line per check, and
exits with status 1 if any check fails. A check fails, and never passes, when
it can't read a fact it gates on. [CI](ci.md#host-qualification) describes each
check and the subset that CI runs.

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--backend {kvm,mshv,whp}` | required | Select the backend to qualify. |
| `--checks ID ...` | `H1` to `H7` | Run only these checks, from `H1` to `H7`, in spec order. |
| `--openvmm PATH` | `openvmm/target/release/openvmm[.exe]` | Select the OpenVMM binary for `H2`, `H3`, and `H6`. |
| `--kernel PATH` | `build/vmlinux` | Select the guest kernel for `H3` and `H6`. |
| `--initrd PATH` | `build/initramfs.cpio.gz` | Select the guest initramfs for `H3` and `H6`. |
| `--cpu-fingerprint PATH` | `nvx-cpu-fingerprint-<backend>.json` in the probe directory | Select where `H2` writes OpenVMM's CPU fingerprint. |
| `--no-openvmm` | off | Qualify without an OpenVMM binary. `H2` then checks the CPU identity and generation but not the CPU profile, and `--checks` must exclude `H3` and `H6`, which boot OpenVMM. |
| `--ci-schedule` | off | Run `H4` and `H6` on CI's short schedules: 3 rate samples 1 s apart instead of 13 samples 10 s apart, and two warp-probe runs instead of five. |
| `--probe-dir PATH` | `$RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE/nvx-host-time-probe`, or `build/host-time-probe` | Select the cache directory for the host probe, which the doctor builds with `rustc`. |
| `--summary PATH` | none | Append a Markdown summary, for example to `$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`. |
| `--timeout SECONDS` | `120` | Set the seconds allowed for each probe or guest. |

### `test-aci-edge-sandboxes`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py test-aci-edge-sandboxes
    --backend {kvm,mshv,whp}
    [--output-dir PATH]
    [--cargo CARGO]
```

Runs the ignored `openvmm_e2e` tests of the [`aci_edge_sandboxes` crate](../aci_edge_sandboxes/README.md)
against a real hypervisor. The tests start sandboxes with `build/vmlinux` and
the Alpine initramfs, whose userland the workloads use directly, and run
workloads. They check the workload identity, timeouts, and cancellation, that
guest state lasts until a stop, and that a start terminates the VM of an
interrupted earlier start before deprovisioning. They check that each workload
starts in its requested working directory, or `/` without one, and that a
missing, non-directory, or inaccessible working directory fails the launch.
They also map temporary host directories read-only, read-write, and denied,
and check egress defaults and
rules against the network gateway, which needs no Internet access. The command requires
Cargo and `openvmm/target/release/openvmm[.exe]`, and writes the OpenVMM log to
`--output-dir` (default `build/test-results/aci_edge_sandboxes`) when the test fails.
The sandboxes keep their state in a temporary directory, which the command deletes
only once every sandbox has been deprovisioned. If the test is interrupted or fails
to stop or deprovision a sandbox, the command keeps the directory and names each
remaining sandbox with the OpenVMM process ID that may still run.

### `test-adversarial`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py test-adversarial
    --backend {kvm,mshv,whp}
    --campaign {workload-isolation,guest-isolation,snapshot-isolation}
    [--budget-seconds SECONDS]
    [--budget-actions COUNT]
    [--budget-ai-credits CREDITS]
    [--seed SEED]
    [--output-dir PATH]
    [--replay ACTIONS.jsonl]
    [--model MODEL]
    [--host-type {baremetal,virtual-machine}]
    [--memory-mib MIB]
    [--phase-timeout SECONDS]
    [--action-timeout SECONDS]
    [--executor-command PATH]
    [--no-minimize]
    [--minimize-attempts COUNT]
```

Runs a bounded adaptive campaign in which an already installed and
authenticated Copilot CLI selects one deterministic primitive at a time.
Copilot has no tools or direct NVX access. The typed broker validates and
records every action, while a credential-free executor and independent
watchdog own VM operation, canaries, teardown checks, and the clean
post-campaign boot.

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--backend` | required | Select KVM or MSHV on Linux, or WHP on Windows. |
| `--campaign` | required | Select workload, privileged-guest, or snapshot boundary probes. |
| `--budget-seconds` | `900` | Bound preflight, actions, canary boot, and minimization wall time. |
| `--budget-actions` | `8` | Bound accepted and executed broker actions. |
| `--budget-ai-credits` | `300` | Bound charged Copilot usage; the minimum is 60 credits so authentication preflight and at least one action each retain a 30-credit CLI cap. |
| `--seed` | `0` | Seed deterministic candidate ordering and synthetic canary data. |
| `--output-dir` | backend-specific path under `build/test-results` | Parent for a unique campaign run directory. |
| `--replay` | none | Replay an `actions.jsonl` bound to its sibling `replay-manifest.json`, without invoking Copilot. |
| `--model` | Copilot auto routing | Select the strategist model. |
| `--host-type` | `NVX_HOST_TYPE` or `unspecified` | Record whether the executor is bare metal or a virtual machine. |
| `--memory-mib` | `256` | Set memory for deterministic microVM scenarios. |
| `--phase-timeout` | `60` | Set each underlying deterministic scenario phase timeout. |
| `--action-timeout` | `600` | Set the outer limit for one action or canary boot. |
| `--executor-command` | local child executor | Select one trusted no-argument wrapper for a separate disposable target. |
| `--no-minimize` | off | Disable fresh-target shorter-prefix replay after an anomaly. |
| `--minimize-attempts` | `3` | Bound shorter-prefix attempts within the campaign time budget. |

Missing or unauthenticated Copilot CLI is a preflight failure in adaptive
mode. Replay mode has no Copilot prerequisite. Production and CI campaigns
must use a separate disposable executor through `--executor-command`; local
mode cannot reliably classify a target-host crash. Local target logs are kept
under the short `build/adv` state root to avoid Windows path-length failures;
the run summary records their absolute location. See
[Copilot-driven adversarial testing](design/copilot-adversarial-testing.md)
for the trust boundary, wrapper contract, artifacts, and CI policy.

## Download and run

### `download`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py download
    [--repository OWNER/REPOSITORY]
    [--hypervisor {auto,whp,kvm,mshv}]
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--repository OWNER/REPOSITORY` | `microsoft/nvx` | GitHub repository from which to download the latest release. |
| `--hypervisor {auto,whp,kvm,mshv}` | `auto` | Select the release platform. `auto` chooses WHP on Windows and KVM on Linux. |

Installing a release replaces the packaged guest artifacts under `build/` and
removes any known guest artifact that the release does not declare, such as the
Azure Linux guest that source-inclusive packages omit.

Windows release downloads support WHP. Linux release downloads support KVM
and MSHV. `download` first uses `GH_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN` when configured.
If GitHub rejects that token with HTTP 401 or 403, NVX reports the failure and
retries without credentials so public releases remain downloadable. Private
repositories require a token with read access to the repository contents that
is authorized for the organization when it enforces single sign-on.

### `run`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py run
    [--guest {alpine,ubuntu,azurelinux}]
    [--hypervisor {auto,whp,kvm,mshv}]

    [--restore-processors {1,2,4,8}]
    [--restore-memory-mib MIB]
    [--restore-ready-path PATH]
    [--dry-run]
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--guest {alpine,ubuntu,azurelinux}` | `alpine` | Select Alpine, Ubuntu, or Azure Linux userland with the same NVX kernel. This option is not used for snapshot restore. |
| `--hypervisor {auto,whp,kvm,mshv}` | `auto` | Select the OpenVMM hypervisor. `auto` chooses WHP on Windows and KVM elsewhere. |
| `--machine {microvm}` | `microvm` | Select the fixed-topology microVM with shared-status edge interrupts. |
| `--memory-mib MIB` | guest-specific | Set guest memory in MiB. Defaults to 128 for Alpine, 512 for Ubuntu, and 512 for Azure Linux. |
| `--memory-capacity-mib MIB` | none | Reserve an immutable, 128 MiB-aligned RAM capacity for a fresh microVM snapshot. |
| `--processors {1,2,4,8}` | `1` | Select the microVM processor count. |
| `--cpu-profile ID` | `auto` | Select the guest's [CPU profile](#cpu-profiles): `auto` for the built-in profile of the host's CPU, a built-in profile ID, or `host` for a development profile derived from this host. A restore uses the snapshot's profile, which `auto` and, for a host profile, `host` also name. |
| `--mount GUEST_TARGET,HOST_PATH[,ro\|rw]` | none | Expose a host directory at the absolute guest target. Repeat once to expose a second directory with its own target and mode; targets and directories must not overlap. An `rw` mapping accepts guest-created symbolic links, which the host never follows. Active snapshot restore requires the same mappings in the same order, with the same canonical paths, targets, modes, and ownership mode; a dormant-slot restore may attach one new mapping that the resumed guest mounts explicitly. |
| `--mount-deny HOST_PATH` | none | Hide one existing file or directory inside a mounted host root; repeat to deny multiple paths. With two mappings, the path must be absolute. |
| `--mount-owner {vmm,caller}` | `vmm` | Select the host identity of the guest's operations on every `--mount` directory. `caller` performs each one as the guest caller's UID and GID and squashes guest root to the directory owner; it requires a Linux host. See [Run](run.md#file-ownership). |
| `--net IPV4/PREFIX` | none | Enable virtio-net with the static guest IPv4 address and prefix. |
| `--network-profile {portable}` | none | Select the required cross-platform network behavior contract; must be specified with `--net`. |
| `--network-egress {allow,deny}` | `allow` | Set the default guest egress policy. |
| `--network-ingress {allow,deny}` | `deny` | Set the default host ingress policy. The portable profile currently supports only `deny`; `allow` is rejected before launch. |
| `--network-egress-allow CIDR[:PROTOCOL:PORT]` | none | Allow matching guest egress; repeat to add rules. |
| `--network-egress-deny CIDR[:PROTOCOL:PORT]` | none | Deny matching guest egress; repeat to add rules. Deny rules take precedence. |
| `--network-egress-policy-file PATH` | none | Load bounded IPv4 ranges and rule-local CIDR exclusions from JSON. Requires explicit `--network-egress`; cannot be mixed with explicit allow/deny rule flags. |
| `--host-loopback {allow,deny}` | existing mapping | Control guest access to host loopback services. |
| `--network-proxy IPV4:TCP-PORT` | none | Allow one explicit host TCP proxy endpoint. |
| `--host-loopback-forward PROTOCOL:HOST_PORT:GUEST_PORT` | none | Publish one TCP or UDP localhost port to the guest; repeat to add forwards. |
| `--outcome-report PATH` | none | Write a bounded local JSON outcome report. |
| `--cmdline TEXT` | empty | Append kernel parameters; `nvx_*` and `tsc=` tokens are reserved. |
| `--restore-snapshot PATH` | none | Restore the immutable machine contract and saved state from a snapshot directory. |
| `--restore-processors {1,2,4,8}` | none | Bring this contiguous processor prefix online before restore readiness. Requires an opt-in microVM snapshot and cannot exceed `--processors` capacity. |
| `--restore-memory-mib MIB` | none | Select the 128 MiB-aligned RAM target for an expansion-capable snapshot restore. |
| `--restore-ready-path PATH` | none | Publish one restore-readiness event to an existing Unix socket or Windows named pipe. |
| `--dry-run` | off | Print the generated OpenVMM command without running it. |

The command requires the OpenVMM release binary, `build/vmlinux`, and the
selected `build/initramfs*.cpio.gz`. Ubuntu selection never falls back to
Alpine. See [Run](run.md) for host setup, guest shutdown, networking, and
virtio-fs examples.

If no built-in CPU profile serves the host's CPU, OpenVMM exits with
`E_PROFILE_HOST_UNKNOWN` before it creates the VM. After a failed cold boot on
such a CPU, `run` names the CPU, lists the CPUs that the built-in profiles
cover, and gives the next steps described in [CPU profiles](#cpu-profiles),
suggesting `--cpu-profile host` only on an Intel or AMD CPU. OpenVMM's own
error, above the guidance, names the cause of the failure. A host whose
hypervisor does not support its built-in profile fails with
`E_PROFILE_UNSUPPORTED` instead, and on an Intel or AMD CPU OpenVMM's error
itself names `--cpu-profile host`.

Network policy and live-share options configure only the `run` and `provision`
launches.

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{run,provision,start,exec,stop,deprovision}` | `run` | Select a one-shot run or a managed lifecycle operation. |
| `--layer ROLE,PATH,EROFS_UUID` | required for `run` and `provision` | Attach a `distro`, `runtime`, or `custom` EROFS layer. Repeat once per distinct role. |
| `--scratch PATH` | required for `run` and `provision` | Attach a preformatted ext4 scratch image as the writable overlay. |
| `--state-dir PATH` | required for managed operations | Select persistent sandbox state. One-shot `run` rejects this option. |
| `--entrypoint PATH` | `/bin/sh` | Select an absolute workload entrypoint without whitespace. |

| `--hostname NAME` | `nvx-sandbox` | Set the workload UTS hostname. |
| `--workload-user UID:GID` | `65534:65534` | Select the fixed non-root workload identity for `run` or `provision`. |
| `--memory-max BYTES` | none | Set the workload cgroup memory limit. |
| `--pids-max COUNT` | none | Set the workload cgroup process limit. |
| `--memory-mib MIB` | `256` | Set guest memory in MiB. |
| `--timeout SECONDS` | `60` | Set the control response timeout for managed `start`, `exec`, and `stop`. |
| `--exec-timeout-ms MILLISECONDS` | `0` | Set the managed `exec` guest workload timeout in the unsigned 32-bit range `0..4294967295`; zero disables the workload deadline. This is separate from the finite host `--timeout` response deadline. |
| `--cwd GUEST_PATH` | `/` | Set an absolute working directory inside the workload root for managed `exec`. It is resolved after the workload identity and root are applied; missing, inaccessible, or non-directory paths fail the workload launch. Default and layered environments point `PWD` at this directory; an exact replacement environment controls `PWD` itself. |
| `--environment KEY=VALUE` | omitted | Set the exact managed `exec` environment. Repeat for multiple entries. Empty values, spaces, additional equals signs, and UTF-8 are preserved. Inline values are visible in the invoking host process arguments; use `--environment-file` for sensitive values. |
| `--environment-file PATH` | omitted | Read the exact managed `exec` environment from a UTF-8 JSON array of `KEY=VALUE` strings, limited to 1 MiB of input. An empty array requests an empty environment. This option is mutually exclusive with `--environment`; omitting both preserves guest defaults. |
| `--inherit-default-environment` | off | Layer the managed `exec` environment from `--environment` or `--environment-file` over the guest default environment instead of replacing it; an entry replaces the default variable of the same name. Without either option the workload already receives the defaults, so the flag has no effect. |
| `--hypervisor {auto,whp,kvm,mshv}` | `auto` | Select the host hypervisor. |
| `--mount GUEST_TARGET,HOST_PATH[,ro\|rw]` | none | Live-share a host directory at the absolute target inside the container rootfs for `run` or `provision`; defaults to `ro`. Repeat once to attach a second share with its own target and mode, for example a read-write workspace and a read-only tool cache; targets and host directories must not overlap. An `rw` share accepts guest-created symbolic links, which the host never follows. `/`, `/etc`, and the `/proc`, `/sys`, `/dev`, and `/.nvx-agent` trees are reserved. |
| `--mount-deny HOST_PATH` | none | Hide one existing file or directory inside a `--mount` host directory; relative paths are resolved inside it. With two shares, it applies to the `--mount` before it. Repeat to deny multiple paths. |
| `--mount-owner {vmm,caller}` | `vmm` | Select the host identity of the shares' file operations for `run` or `provision`. `vmm` performs them as OpenVMM; `caller` performs them as the workload's UID and GID, squashes guest root to the owner of each host directory, and fails them with `EPERM` when OpenVMM cannot assume that identity. `caller` requires a Linux host and is persisted by `provision`. See [File ownership](run.md#file-ownership). |
| `--net IPV4/PREFIX` | none | Enable virtio-net with a static guest address. |
| `--network-profile {portable}` | none | Select the required cross-platform network behavior contract; must be specified with `--net`. |
| `--network-egress {allow,deny}` | `allow` | Set the default guest egress policy for `run` or `provision`. |
| `--network-ingress {allow,deny}` | `deny` | Set the host ingress policy for `run` or `provision`. The portable profile supports only `deny`. |
| `--network-egress-allow CIDR[:PROTOCOL:PORT]` | none | Allow matching guest egress; repeat to add rules. Requires explicit `--network-egress`. |
| `--network-egress-deny CIDR[:PROTOCOL:PORT]` | none | Deny matching guest egress; repeat to add rules. Requires explicit `--network-egress`; deny rules take precedence. |
| `--network-egress-policy-file PATH` | none | Load bounded IPv4 ranges and rule-local CIDR exclusions for `run` or `provision`. Managed provision persists lowered rules, not this path. Requires explicit `--network-egress`; cannot be mixed with explicit allow/deny rule flags. |
| `--host-loopback {allow,deny}` | existing mapping | Control guest access to host loopback services for `run` or `provision`. |
| `--network-proxy IPV4:TCP-PORT` | none | Allow one explicit host TCP proxy endpoint; the IPv4 address must match the guest gateway. |
| `--host-loopback-forward PROTOCOL:HOST_PORT:GUEST_PORT` | none | Publish one TCP or UDP localhost port to the guest; repeat to add forwards and set `--host-loopback allow`. |
| `--outcome-report PATH` | none | Write a bounded local JSON outcome report for one-shot `run` or managed `exec`. |
| `--cmdline TEXT` | empty | Append non-sandbox kernel parameters; `nvx_*`, `virtfs_*`, and `tsc=` tokens are reserved. |
| `--dry-run` | off | For one-shot `run` only, print the generated OpenVMM microVM command without running it. Managed operations reject this option. |

See [Run](run.md) for artifact preparation, the security boundary, and current
snapshot/configuration limitations.

## CPU profiles

Every microVM presents a CPU profile to its guest: the complete CPUID surface
of one CPU generation, which OpenVMM pins and every backend shares (see the
[time ABI](design/time-abi.md#cpu-profiles)). By default, OpenVMM selects the
built-in profile of the host's CPU generation:

| Profile | Generation | CPUs (display family/model) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `intel.skylake-sp.v1` | `skylake-sp` | Intel Xeon Scalable, first generation (6/85, steppings 0 to 4) |
| `intel.icelake-sp.v1` | `icelake-sp` | Intel Xeon Scalable, third generation (6/106) |
| `intel.emeraldrapids.v1` | `emeraldrapids` | Intel Xeon Scalable, fifth generation (6/207) |
| `intel.alderlake.v1` | `alderlake` | Intel Core, twelfth generation (6/151 and 6/154) |
| `amd.milan.v1` | `milan` | AMD EPYC, third generation (25/1, Milan-X included) |

Any other CPU, including Cascade Lake, Sapphire Rapids, Tiger Lake, Raptor
Lake, and AMD's Genoa and Ryzen CPUs, fails with `E_PROFILE_HOST_UNKNOWN`. A
host of a listed generation can still fail with `E_PROFILE_UNSUPPORTED` if its
SKU or hypervisor lacks a feature of the profile, and on an Intel or AMD CPU
OpenVMM's error then names `--cpu-profile host`: `intel.alderlake.v1` derives
from one Core i9-12900H on WHP, and `amd.milan.v1` from one EPYC 7763 Azure
VM on WHP, so Alder Lake and Milan hosts on KVM and MSHV, and SKUs without
their features, are unverified. The Milan profile leaves out what KVM cannot
present, `BTC_NO` and PSFD without a `SPEC_CTRL` control, and presents none
of the speculation controls that the Azure VM's WHP withholds, so its Linux
guests use retpolines and report SSB, SRSO, and TSA as vulnerable on every
host.

On an Intel or AMD development host that no built-in profile serves, or whose
hypervisor does not support its built-in profile, `run --cpu-profile host`
opts in to a host profile, `intel.host.v1` or `amd.host.v1`. OpenVMM
fingerprints the hypervisor on this host and applies the built-in profiles'
derivation policy to it, so the guest sees the same kind of filtered CPU
surface, and verifies it as it verifies a built-in profile: a cold boot still
fails with `E_PROFILE_UNSUPPORTED` if the hypervisor lacks a CPU feature that
the time ABI requires. A host profile is for development only:

- It is not pinned: a microcode, firmware, hypervisor, or OS update can change
  it.
- Each cold boot fingerprints the hypervisor first, which adds a few to tens
  of milliseconds, depending on the hypervisor.
- A snapshot records its host profile, and restores only on a host with the
  same CPU model and stepping whose hypervisor supports the profile.
- `doctor` never qualifies it, so benchmark and CI hosts need a built-in
  profile.

[#390](https://github.com/microsoft/nvx/issues/390) tracks built-in profiles
for more CPUs, and [#396](https://github.com/microsoft/nvx/issues/396) for
more AMD CPUs; host profiles serve no CPU of another vendor than Intel and
AMD. A profile derives from fingerprints of its generation's hosts on every
backend that it serves; see `vmm_core/cpu_profile` in the OpenVMM submodule.

## Benchmarking

### `benchmark`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py benchmark [OPTIONS]
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `--suite {boot,snapshot,restore,e2e,phase2,snapshot-profile,all,cold-start,device-io,device-restore-profile,network-snapshot,performance,shell-snapshot,shell-snapshot-restore,snapshot-restore-memory,snapshot-restore-vcpu,virtfs}` | `boot` | Select an acceptance, diagnostic, or workload suite. |

The `e2e` suite uses the general memory size and measures cold start, snapshot
generation, snapshot restore, guest-exit teardown, and peak RSS against the
shell-ready markers. CI uses the default 128 MiB baseline.
See [Benchmark](benchmarks.md) for suite semantics, platform support, metric
definitions, and complete examples.

### `performance`

`performance` processes benchmark outputs for CI. It requires one nested
command.

#### `performance collect`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py performance collect
    --platform PLATFORM
    --commit COMMIT
    --input-dir PATH
    --output-dir PATH
    [--require-network]
    [--require-shell-snapshot]
    [--require-shared-suite]
    [--require-shell-snapshot-restore-512]
    [--lifecycle-input PATH]
    [--summary PATH]
```

Parses canonical benchmark logs into p50 CSV files. The `--require-*` flags
reject incomplete inputs for their respective workload sets.
`--require-shell-snapshot-restore-512` accepts only the canonical 512 MiB
restore metric from a 2-, 4-, or 8-vCPU run.
`--lifecycle-input` validates and merges a 128 MiB, guest-exit `e2e` JSON
result, producing the 29-metric microVM CI result. A directory whose metadata
selects `device-io` is collected as five additional ABI-2, one-vCPU `ops/s`
metrics; CI merges them into a 34-metric one-vCPU result.
`--summary` writes the p50 table plus lifecycle min/max/sample-count and RSS diagnostics.

#### `performance validate-openvmm`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py performance validate-openvmm
    --platform PLATFORM
    --input PATH
```

Validates a complete 128 MiB, guest-exit OpenVMM `e2e` result without
writing a CSV. Snapshot-generation instability exits with status 75 so
callers can remeasure the temporary host condition selectively; other
malformed or incomplete inputs exit with status 2.

#### `performance collect-openvmm`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py performance collect-openvmm
    --platform PLATFORM
    --commit COMMIT
    --input PATH
    --output-dir PATH
    [--summary PATH]
```

Converts a complete 128 MiB, guest-exit OpenVMM `e2e` result into an
eight-metric lifecycle p50 CSV.

#### `performance gate`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py performance gate
    --baseline-dir PATH
    --target-dir PATH
    [--window N]
    [--minimum-history N]
    [--threshold PERCENT]
    [--absolute-tolerance-ms MILLISECONDS]
    [--history-reset-dir PATH]
    [--summary PATH]
```

Checks target p50 values for regressions against rolling baseline histories.
`--window` defaults to `10`, `--minimum-history` to `10`, `--threshold` to
`40`, and `--absolute-tolerance-ms` to `5`. The gate uses the median of the
available window and treats metrics with insufficient history as warmups.
`--summary` writes a Markdown summary.
`--history-reset-dir` names tracked candidate histories; metrics removed from
an existing history file restart baseline warmup.

#### `performance persist`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py performance persist
    --source-dir PATH
    --history-dir PATH
    [--exclude-metric NAME]...
```

Appends current p50 values to branch history. Repeat `--exclude-metric` to omit
more than one metric.

## Source and package commands

### `collect-sources`

```console
python3 scripts/nvx.py collect-sources
```

Materializes the verified Linux, Alpine, and Ubuntu source artifacts needed
for a source-inclusive release. Azure Linux corresponding source is not
collected, so source-inclusive packages omit the Azure Linux guest.

### `collect-alpine-sources`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py collect-alpine-sources MANIFEST [MANIFEST ...]
    [--output PATH]
    [--cache PATH]
    [--skip-upstream]
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MANIFEST` | required | One or more Alpine package manifests to collect. |
| `--output PATH` | `build/sources/alpine` | Select the output directory. |
| `--cache PATH` | `.cache/aports` | Select the aports cache directory. |
| `--skip-upstream` | off | Collect exact aports recipes without running `abuild fetch`. |

Each run replaces the generated `recipes`, `upstream`, `manifest.json`, and
`SHA256SUMS` entries. The collector rejects an output path that is a symlink or
a Windows junction, and an output directory that contains anything else.
Release checksum manifests reject symlinks, so a recipe symlink is stored as a
regular copy of its target. Links that leave the recipe, hard links, and
special files are rejected.

### `collect-ubuntu-sources`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py collect-ubuntu-sources MANIFEST [MANIFEST ...]
    [--output PATH]
    [--cache PATH]
```

| Option | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MANIFEST` | required | One or more Ubuntu package or EROFS manifests to collect. |
| `--output PATH` | `build/sources/ubuntu` | Select the output directory. |
| `--cache PATH` | `.cache/ubuntu-source-indexes` | Select the downloaded source-index cache. |

The collector requires `gpgv`, deduplicates source package name/version pairs,
authenticates live or historical Ubuntu source indexes through signed
`InRelease` metadata and the pinned Ubuntu archive keyring, validates each
`.dsc`, and downloads every referenced source member.

### `create-linux-source-archive`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py create-linux-source-archive
    --config PATH
    --output PATH
```

Creates the deterministic Linux corresponding-source archive from the pinned
kernel inputs and the generated kernel configuration. `--config` must name an
existing generated kernel configuration, and `--output` names the archive to
create.

### `package`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py package
    [--version VERSION]
    [--destination PATH]
    (--include-source | --binary-only)
    [--force]
```

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--version VERSION` | Override the packaged version. |
| `--destination PATH` | Override the staging destination. |
| `--include-source` | Include the corresponding source artifacts in the package and omit the Azure Linux guest artifacts. |
| `--binary-only` | Stage binaries only; publish corresponding source separately. |
| `--force` | Replace an existing staging destination. |

Exactly one of `--include-source` and `--binary-only` is required. See
[Package and source delivery](distribution.md) for release procedures and
source-publication requirements.

### `archive-release`

```text
python3 scripts/nvx.py archive-release
    --source PATH
    --destination PATH
```

Validates the staged distribution against its `SHA256SUMS`, snapshots the
accepted inventory, and creates a deterministic archive at the destination.
The destination must be outside the source directory and end in `.tar.gz` or
`.zip`.
